bashweather
===========

Very simple client to grab the sky conditions and temperature for a specified location and save it to a file for inclusion in your bash prompt.

Installation:

Copy the getweather.py and .bash_profile to your home directory. Create a cron job to fire getweather.py as often as you wish. The .bash_profile is very basic so customize away! To modify the weather for your city, change the city to the format of 'city, country' or 'city, state'. Modify the home parameter for your home folder and you should be good to go.
